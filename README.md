## About

**ZTM-20-JS** is a code repository for the [JavaScript Web Projects course][ztm] by Andrei Neagoie & Jacinto Wong.

The aim for this project is to have fun with some little projects, experiment with CSS, and use more vanilla JavaScript.

## Installation

You probably want to have Node.js installed for convenience.

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
$ npx degit sophiabrandt/ZTM-JS-20
```

## Usage

Each project has a folder. Navigate into the project, then run the following command inside the terminal:

```bash
$ npx live-server
```

This will open a new tab in your standard web browser on port 8080 ([http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)).

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
